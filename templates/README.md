# Templates

Boilerplate files and starter patterns for new Power Platform projects.

This folder is currently empty. When adding templates:
- Include clear placeholders for customization (e.g., `{{APP_NAME}}`)
- Document what to modify before use
- Consider including both minimal and full-featured variants
